# Box Plot for GPS Trajectory implemented in Python using matplotlib

The box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. [1]

The Box Plot for GPS Trajectory uses following attributes to display the data -
1. id_android - Represents the device used to capture the instance.
2. speed - Represents the average speed (Km/H).
3. distance - Represents the total distance (Km).
4. rating - Evaluation parameter. Evaluation the traffic is a way to verify the volunteerâ€™s perception about the traffic during the travel, in other words, if volunteers move to some place and face traffic jam, maybe they will evaluate 'bad'. (3- good, 2- normal, 1-bad). 
5. rating_bus - It is other evaluation parameter. (1 - The amount of people inside the bus is little, 2 - The bus is not crowded, 3- The bus is crowded. 
6. rating_weather - Another evaluation parameter. (1 - raining, 2 - sunny).
